        <p class="contentbox-content">
            <p>The SSP group has a mailing list for email based discussions and holds frequent teleconferences to discuss the
                technical evolution of the standard. In addition, there are often SSP tracks at other SSP related events
                like conferences and design meetings. Development of the SSP standard is centrally managed at the <a href="https://trac.fmi-standard.org">SSP Trac Site</a>.
                This site is used to keep track of open issues with the current specification and proposals for future versions.
                If you believe you could benefit from the standard or if you would like to contribute to the improvement
                or distribution of it, please contact us at: <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#104;&#116;&#116;&#112;&#115;&#058;&#047;&#047;&#116;&#114;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#102;&#109;&#105;&#045;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#097;&#114;&#100;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">contact@fmi-standard.org</a>.</p>
