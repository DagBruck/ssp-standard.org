            <p> The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a tool independent standard to
                support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models using a
                combination of xml-files and compiled C-code.

        <p class="contentbox-content">
            <p>At the beginning of the ITEA2 project MODELISAR (the project in which FMI was initially developed) it was planned
                to develop FMI for Applications. The intention was to specify an API for simulation tools that allows the
                access of model parameters, stimulations and simulation results and to control simulation experiments as
                well. The API was supposed to provide tool independent access to simulation computations for optimization
                tools, test management and workflow definition tools.</p>

            <p>The project group noticed the parallel work of the ASAM XIL standardization group. Thus, both groups came to
                the conclusion not to develop a parallel standard but to cooperate. The result of this cooperation is available
                as ASAM XIL-MA, which is a subset from ASAM XIL standard. It contains the model access port specification
                as well as necessary common functionality for a proper operation of the model access. XIL-MA is open to public
                and the documentation of the standard can be obtained from ASAM for free without membership.</p>

            <p>One of the topics of the Smart Systems Engineering project is to find solutions for the cross-disciplinary and
                cross-enterprise exchange of behavioral models. The Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) is viewed as the basic
                technology for the exchange.</p>
