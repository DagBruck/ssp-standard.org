            <p>To continue the cooperation of the FMI development partners beyond MODELISAR, the core development partners decided
                to find a new home for their activities under the roof of the Modelica Association. According to the Bylaws
                of the Modelica Association, a new <a href="https://modelica.org/projects">Modelica Association Project</a>                “Functional Mock-up Interface” was created.</p>

            <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>

            <p>Development, standardization and promoting the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) definition, one result of the
                ITEA2 project MODELISAR. The intention is that dynamic system models of different software systems can be
                used together for software/model/hardware-in-the-loop simulation, for cyber physical systems, and other applications.</p>
