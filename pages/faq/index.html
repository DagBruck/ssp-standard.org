        <p class="contentbox-content">
            <p>Access and use of the SSP standard is free of charge. However, vendors may charge for their tools to support
                the SSP standard, either by exporting FMUs or by importing FMUs.</p>

            <p><strong>To be clear: While the SSP standard is open and free, commercial implementations might not be.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="title title-two contentbox-title">Where can I get help when I have problems related to SSP in my simulation tool?</h3>
        <p class="contentbox-content">
            <ul>
                <li>Typically an exporting and an importing tool are involved in SSP-based simulation. So if problems occur and
                    if it is not obvious which tool causes the problem, you should communicate the problem to the support
                    team of both involved tools</li>
                <li>As a general discussion forum about SSP, you may use the SSP forum on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/SSP">Stack Overflow</a></li>
